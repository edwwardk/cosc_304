## Course Description
**Official Calendar:** Databases from a user's perspective: querying with SQL, designing with UML, and using programs to analyze data. Construction of database-driven applications and websites and experience with current database technologies.  Completion of COSC 121 is recommended.
**Prerequisite:** One of COSC 111, COSC 123, COSC 210. Third-year standing.

**Specific description:** This course provides an introduction to database systems including database querying, design, and programming. The course consists of three major components. The first component explains databases from a user perspective including how to query using SQL and relational algebra. The second component involves designing relational databases using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and UML. The last component involves experiential learning on real-world use cases of databases for software development and data analytics. Technologies used include Java, JDBC, JSP, Python, and PHP. Students completing the course have experience with current database technologies, and the ability to use databases, analyze the contained data, and develop programs to automate data analysis and presentation.

## Course Objectives
**Course Format:** Interactive classes consist of topic introduction, understanding evaluation using quick questions, and concept mastery with larger exercises.  Practical skills and applications of topics are covered in assignments as well as practice using industrial database systems and software.

**Learning Outcomes:**
 - Describe how databases provide data abstraction and simplify writing programs to store and manipulate data.
 - Create relational algebra queries on relational databases using selection, projection, join, and set operators.
 - Construct SQL CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements including queries with multiple joins, aggregation, grouping, and subqueries. Explain the translation of a SQL query into relational algebra operators.
 - Analyze and understand existing database designs, design new databases using ER/UML modeling, and convert designs to the relational model including proper modeling of primary and foreign keys.
 - Develop programs and web sites that access a database to read data, perform analysis, and display output.
 - Perform data analysis, reporting, and visualization using data extracted from databases.
 - Use JSON and XML for data exchange and representation.
 - Execute and deploy databases on a computer using virtualization/containerization technology such as Docker.
 - Implement database security using user accounts/passwords and SQL privileges using GRANT and REVOKE.

## Missing an Exam
Only students who miss the final exam for a reason that corresponds to the University of British Columbia Okanagan's policy on excused absences from examinations will be permitted to take the final exam at a later time. A make-up exam may have a question format different from the regular exam. There will be no make-up midterm exams.  If the reason for absence is satisfactory, the student’s final exam will be worth more of the final grade.  Further information on Academic Concession is in the Academic Calendar http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0.

## Grievances and Complaints Procedures
A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:
 - The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor. 
 - If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should e-mail the Department Head, Dr. Sylvie Desjardins, sylvie.desjardins@ubc.ca. 
 
## Your Responsibilities
Your responsibilities to this class and to your education as a whole include attendance and participation. You have a
responsibility to help create a classroom environment where all may learn. At the most basic level, this means you will
respect the other members of the class and the instructor and treat them with the courtesy you hope to receive in return.
Inappropriate classroom behavior may include: disruption of the classroom atmosphere, engaging in non-class activities,
talking on a cell-phone, inappropriate use of profanity in classroom discussion, use of abusive or disrespectful language
toward the instructor, a student in the class, or about other individuals or groups.

## Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.  As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.  This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.  Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.  For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.  Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the policies and procedures, may be found: http://okanagan.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0  If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.

**The use of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, for any assessed portions of this course is not permitted unless explicitly specified by the instructor.**
